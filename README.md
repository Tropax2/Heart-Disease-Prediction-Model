This repo contains a prediction model applied that predicts wether or not an individual is likely to have heart disease.

Since it regards a classification problem we use three different models and compare them: Logistic Regression, LDA and QDA.

The files it contains are the following:
- The dataset in CSV format from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arezaei81/heartcsv);
- Python files with the treatment of the data and the implementation of the model, as well as its performance.

Features:
- Loads and preprocesses the dataset;
- Implements a predictive model for heart disease;
- Evaluates model performance.

Dependencies:
- Python 3;
- NumPy;
- Pandas;
- Scikit-learn;
- Statsmodels.

Usage:
- Copy the repo;
- Ensure the dataset CSV is in the correct location or update the path in the script;
- Run the Python script.
